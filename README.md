# House-Price-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The main goal is to build and compare various machine learning models, including an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented with Keras and Tensorflow.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AkshatJain20092002/house-price-prediction.git
